Didn't have my usual IDE installed, so stuck to the basics on this project.  No Test cases, and documented and explained what I did and why.

There are definitely things I would do differently if this was a true production level deployment, but given this is just a quick skills test, here you go.

Also, debated Double vs Float, but even with very long rental periods, the billing per day is small enough that floats should cover most reasonable options.
